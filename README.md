# Interstellar (2014)

## My favorite movie
Interstellar follows a team of astronauts who venture through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new habitable planet for humanity. As Earth faces ecological collapse, Cooper, a former pilot, joins the mission, navigating themes of love, sacrifice, and the mysteries of space-time as he confronts humanity's future and his bond with his daughter, Murph.

## Why did I like this?
The movie features the science fiction genre. The graphics and concepts were very realistic in terms of theory of relativity. I really enjoyed the show, and it feels like a rollercoaster to watch even though it lasts stunningly more than 3 hours!
